# About structure of repository.
1. Look at branches. You should see lsn1 | The Vue instance, etc. lsn1 Means lesson 1 or just first lesson and logically lsn33 means lesson 33.
2. Every lesson have properly written documentation or README.md
3. This repo contains not only limited lessons. Also you can contribute and add some new features.
For this branch that is all :) Good luck
