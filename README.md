## Learn Vue.js STEP BY STEP <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vuejs/art/master/logo.png" width=50px title="Learn Vue.js STEP BY STEP">

You can't write your Vue.js code instantly.
1. You need to include by script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"
2. Write your code in app.js **or**  just insert between script tags.

```javascript
let app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
});
```

you can just type it without defining to some variable like `let app`
`el: '#app',` it accept argument or element that you have in html. usually it's div tag.
It's like CSS selectors. # means id, . means class.
And our html element is here.
```
<div id="app"> </div>
```
